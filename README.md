I implemented sticky notes over a picture background. I designed the notes with borders and increased opacity so that the sticky notes are highlighted against the background. I chose to implement the creation of the node as an input box/create note button combo (with an animation on the button). Additionally, the notes can be edited by pressing the editing note button, and changes are saved as you type but the editing mode is ended by pressing the save button. It works effectively across multiple screens.

Something I had some trouble with on the lab, at least initially, was figuring out how to normalize the note positions across multiple windows. However, I was able to fix it without too much trouble and a push in the right direction at office hours from Trevor.

I did not attempt the extra credit but did make an extra effort to verify that there were no wrinkles with any of the minimum functionality requirements.
